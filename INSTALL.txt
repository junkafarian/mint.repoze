This application is built on top of repoze.bfg. If you experience problems installing this package, 
refer to the installation instructions in the http://docs.repoze.org/bfg/

Download the codebase from the github repository using:

    git clone git://github.com/junkafarian/mint.repoze.git mint.repoze

When these are installed you should be able to install the rest of the dependencies as usual 
by installing the code as a development package using setuptools:

    $ cd /path/to/project
    $ python setup.py develop

n.b. It is advisable to run the above command in a dedicated virtual environment (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv)

You will also need to create a ZEO instance for the project by running:

    $ mkzeoinst .
    $ ./bin/zeoctl start

(The plan is to provide a buildout script in future)

Then test the application to make sure it works:

    $ nosetests
    OR
    $ python setup.py test

then serve the application with:

    $ paster serve etc/develop.ini

enjoy!
